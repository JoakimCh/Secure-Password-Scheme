# JLC's Secure Password Scheme PWA

## Short description

A progressive web application (PWA) to manage your passwords in a super secure way (accessible to all your devices) without needing to store them anywhere or sync any data; since they're procedurally generated (on demand) directly on your device. You only need to remember your master password and from it super strong passwords can be generated for every service you want to use with this scheme.

## About this project

This is actually my first PWA, I created it because I wanted such an app for myself. Because I'm tired of insecure ways of syncing passwords between devices and I don't trust third parties like e.g. LastPass (which got hacked)...

I will write more here later.

Please sponsor me here on GitHub if you like it. I am sick, without a job and could really need the money for my two kids...
